However, there are times when a single field may be desirable, for example:\n\n  - Rapid development, when you're planning ahead and trying out data models.\n  - When you're refactoring to or from a record you may need to step through a single record.\n  - To match the pattern of similar data types and to make a predictable API.\n  - When you're working with generic records matching only one field, e.g., `{ r | some : String }`. Although, these should be refactored to take one field.\n\n\n## Try it out\n\nYou can try this rule out by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nelm-review --template sparksp/elm-review-rules-to-avoid/example --rules NoSingleFieldRecord\n```\n\n","type":"Review.Rule.Rule"}],"binops":[]}]
